            <li><h3>Pyramid of Giza</h3></li>
            <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops, is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex located in Egypt. It was built more than 4,500 years ago, during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty.
                The pyramid was originally built as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu, and it is estimated that it took around 20 years to construct, with a workforce of over 100,000 people. The pyramid is made of more than 2 million blocks of limestone, each weighing around 2.5 tons.
                The pyramid is approximately 147 meters tall and covers an area of over 5 hectares. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years until the completion of the Lincoln Cathedral in England in 1311.
                The Great Pyramid of Giza is considered one of the most remarkable achievements of ancient Egyptian civilization, and it continues to fascinate and inspire people from all over the world to this day.
